Cadasta is a suite of tools for providing partners with a way to get boundary lines, ownership/tenant information and much more information stored up in the cloud in a safe and secure way. All data collected in Cadasta is owned by the person who collected and imported it. 

You are welcome to use the demo platform at https://demo.cadasta.org for playing around and testing.  Happy Mapping!

Install for development
-----------------------

Install:

* `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_
    * Version 5.0.x
* `Vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com/>`_
    * Version 1.8.1
    * If you are behind a proxy, you may need to install and configure the `vagrant-proxyconf <https://rubygems.org/gems/vagrant-proxyconf/versions/1.5.2>`_ plugin
* `Ansible <http://www.ansible.com/>`_
    * Version 2.1.3.0
    * For Linux and Mac, install Ansible 2 via pip
    * For Windows (unsupported), go through `Ansible Documentation <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_windows.html>`_ or this `blog <https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/running-ansible-within-windows>`_

Clone the `repository <https://github.com/cadasta/cadasta-platform>`_ to your local machine and enter the cadasta-platform directory.
Run the following commands to access the virtual machine.

Provision the VM::

  vagrant up --provision

SSH into the VM (automatically activates the Python virtual environment)::

  vagrant ssh
  
Enter the cadasta directory and start the server:: 
 
  cd cadasta
  ./runserver

Open ``http://localhost:8000/`` in your local machine's browser. This will forward you to the web server port on the VM and you should see the front page of the platform site.

See the wiki (`here <https://devwiki.corp.cadasta.org/Installation>`_ and `here <https://devwiki.corp.cadasta.org/Run%20for%20development>`_) for detailed instructions on installation and running the platform for development.

Run tests
---------

Within the development VM, from the ``/vagrant`` directory run::

  py.test cadasta

To get coverage reports run::

  py.test cadasta --cov=cadasta  --cov-report=html

This creates a HTML report under ``htmlcov``. See `pytest-cov docs <http://pytest-cov.readthedocs.org/en/latest/readme.html#reporting>`_ for other report formats.

AWS Deployment
--------------

Do this::

  vagrant box add dummy https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws/raw/master/dummy.box
  vagrant plugin install vagrant-aws
  ...

  vagrant up --provider=aws ...
